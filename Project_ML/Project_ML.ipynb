    "For my project, I worked with two stocks, NFLX (Netflix) and ZM (Zoom). Running all three functions of the module allows me to compare how the two stocks did in March 2020, the month when fears of the virus pandemic escalated drastically. Many stocks took a hit, as seen in the chart for NFLX. However, for some, it was an opportunity to grow, such as ZM. For example, ZM had 14 days where its opening prices was higher compared to the previous day versus NFLX's 12. I researched on how to use inputs when calling functions. My functions would go through files to find differences in opening prices to print out a list of days, or print out the stock prices in the form of a chart."
